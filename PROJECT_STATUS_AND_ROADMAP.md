# OpenAvatarChat Project Status and Roadmap

## üéâ PROJECT STATUS: WebRTC DataChannel Issues RESOLVED

**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Environment:** Mac M3 Max, Docker-based deployment  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Core WebRTC functionality working perfectly

---

## üîß COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. WebRTC DataChannel InvalidStateError Fix

**Problem:** 
```
InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': RTCDataChannel.readyState is not 'open'
```

**Root Cause:** 
- Application was attempting to send data through RTCDataChannels before they reached the 'open' state
- Race condition between WebRTC connection establishment and message sending
- Missing state validation in both backend (Python) and frontend (JavaScript) code

**Solution Implemented:**

#### Backend (Python) Fixes:
- **File:** `src/service/rtc_service/rtc_stream.py`
  - Added `safe_channel_send()` function with comprehensive state checking
  - Replaced all direct `channel.send()` calls with safe wrapper
  - Enhanced error logging and graceful degradation

- **Files:** Multiple FastRTC backend files
  - `src/third_party/gradio_webrtc_videochat/backend/fastrtc/tracks.py`
  - `src/third_party/gradio_webrtc_videochat/backend/fastrtc/utils.py` 
  - `src/third_party/gradio_webrtc_videochat/backend/fastrtc/reply_on_stopwords.py`
  - `src/third_party/gradio_webrtc_videochat/backend/fastrtc/webrtc_connection_mixin.py`
  - Added readyState validation before all DataChannel send operations

#### Frontend (JavaScript) Fixes:
- **File:** `src/handlers/client/rtc_client/frontend/src/views/VideoChat/index.vue`
  - Updated DataChannel message sending to check readyState
  - Added comprehensive debugging and error handling

- **File:** `src/handlers/client/rtc_client/frontend/src/store/index.ts`
  - Added `safeSendDataChannel()` method to Vue store
  - Implemented proper state validation and error reporting

### 2. VAD (Voice Activity Detection) Blocking Issue Fix

**Problem:**
- Second and subsequent messages were not being processed
- VAD system was disabling message processing after first interaction

**Root Cause:**
- `enable_vad` was being set to `False` after processing first message
- System expected VAD to be re-enabled by other mechanisms
- DataChannel text messages were incorrectly blocked by voice activity logic

**Solution:**
- **File:** `src/service/rtc_service/rtc_stream.py`
- Commented out VAD disabling for DataChannel text messages
- Text-based chat no longer interferes with voice activity detection

### 3. Chat UI Visibility Issues

**Problem:**
- Chat responses were being received but not displayed in UI
- Chat records component visibility conditions were restrictive

**Solution:**
- Added debugging to identify visibility conditions
- User can now toggle chat visibility using subtitle button
- Enhanced debugging tools for ongoing troubleshooting

## üìù NOTES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Language Models:** The project's Chinese origins mean many components default to Chinese. Systematic internationalization is crucial.

2. **Model Compatibility:** When replacing models, ensure they're compatible with the existing pipeline architecture.

3. **Performance:** Mac M3 optimizations are already in place. Future models should leverage ARM64 acceleration where possible.

4. **Error Handling:** The DataChannel fixes provide a template for robust error handling. Apply similar patterns to other components.

5. **Debugging:** Comprehensive logging has been added to WebRTC components. Extend similar debugging to audio/avatar systems.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Phase 1 Development  
**Next Action:** Begin internationalization and model migration planning  
**Contact:** Maintain Docker container and test environment setup
